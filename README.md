I enjoy building business solutions on Google's Cloud Platform. I like to sling microservices, databases, data pipelines and data warehouses to design and construct good apps and feed machine learning systems!

## My skills and experience include the following:
1. Java
2. TypeScript
3. NodeJS
4. Springboot
5. SQL and NOSQL databases
6. Google Cloud Platform services
7. Flutter with Firebase
8. Stellar Payments Blockchain

🍎 ... learning Web3 and getting my arms dirty right up to the elbows! 🍎
